# If we want to perform a set of independent operations on some data, the
# conventional approach is to apply each operation in turn. The disadvantage of
# this is that if one of the operations is slow, the program as a whole must wait
# for the operation to complete before going on to the next one. A solution to this
# is to use coroutines.

# have created the @coroutine decorator to do this for us.
