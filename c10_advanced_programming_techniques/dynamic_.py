# If exec() is called with some code as its only argument there is no way to
# access any functions or variables that are created as a result of the code being
# executed. Furthermore, exec() cannot access any imported modules or any of
# the variables, functions, or other objects that are in scope at the point of the
# call. Both of these problems can be solved by passing a dictionary as the second
# argument. The dictionary provides a place where object references can be kept
# for accessing after the exec() call has finished. For example, the use of the
# context dictionary means that after the exec() call, the dictionary has an object
# reference to the area_of_sphere() function that was created by exec() . In this
# example we needed exec() to be able to access the math module, so we inserted
# an item into the context dictionary whose key is the moduleâ€™s name and whose
# value is an object reference to the corresponding module object. This ensures
# that inside the exec() call, math.pi is accessible.
